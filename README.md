### Notes on development

- Spacing on footer links were inconsistent in the design document - have made this even in development
- Fomt changes:
  - Changed hero font size desktop to 134px
  - Changed primary text letter spacing to -0.06em
  - Changed link font size desktop to 18px
  - Changed hero font size and line height to 49 amd 49 respectivly

### Improvements

- Image optimazation (srcset, lazyloading etc)
- 'Back to start' on carousel
- Add a mixin to handle font size output over breakpoints
- Add additional styles for breakpoint between small and medium (what would be tablet size)
